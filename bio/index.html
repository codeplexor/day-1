        <p>1) Why or how got interested in coding:</p>
        <p>Got interested in coding at my last job as an SSD Systems Engineer at Micron Technology, in Boise.</p> 
        <p>2) Why or how got interested in Boise CodeWorks:</p>
        <p>
        A friend of mine mentioned I should check out Boise CodeWorks (BCW) as a great place to get formal training <br>
        since their approach emphasizes hands-on and the instructors have industry experience. <br>
        Once the opportunity arose I did not hesitate to pursue this interest further by enrolling in the winter 2017 <br>
        Full Stack Web Developer Immersive cohort. <br> 
        </p>
        <p>3) Goals or objectives for this CodeWorks Bootcamp:</p>
        <p> 
        My hope is that by the end of my training I will be proficient enough at coding that I can land a position as a  <br>
        Jr. Web Developer.<br>
        I am super excited about this journey, all the new stuff I will be learning, the great instructors, TA's,<br>
        and above all the fellow future web developers I will be meeting during my training.<br>
