    <title>Rui Silva Brief Bio</title>

<body>
    <h3>Hello CodeWorks!</h3>

    <p>My name is <strong>Rui Silva.</strong></p>

    <p>Got interested in coding at my last job as an Electrical Engineer working on SSD's at Micron Technology. <br>
       A friend of mine mentioned I should check out Boise CodeWorks (BCW) as a great place to get my formal training <br>
       since their approach emphasizes hands-on and the instructors have industry experience. <br>
       Once the opportunity arose I did not hesitate to pursue this interest further by enrolling in the winter 2017 <br>
       Full Stack Immersive cohort. <br> 
       My hope is that I will be proficient enough at coding that I can land a position in the future as a Jr. Web Developer, <br>
       once I complete my training.<br>
       I am super excited about this journey, all the new stuff I will be learning, the great instructors, TA's,<br>
       and above all the fellow future web developers I will be meeting during my training.<br>   
    </p>
